# Artefacto: Discover Events, Create Memories


## Project Overview


### Project description

The project aimed to develop a user-friendly web or app platform for the cultural sector, including theatre, museums, orchestras, and galleries, to display event dates and information accurately.

Users can create, explore, filter events, book tickets, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences. A team of developers, designers, project managers collaborated to create a robust platform that met the needs of the culture industry and its users.

The platform not only benefited end-users but also helped cultural organizers reach a broader audience. By providing a centralized platform for event information, cultural organizers could increase visibility and attendance for their events. The platform also offered a convenient way for organizers to update and manage event information, reducing the workload on their end.
